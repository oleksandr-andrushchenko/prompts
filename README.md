## Lambda layout

- `shared/` — shared backend code and templates
- `web-lambda/` — website Lambda handler and dependencies
- `api-lambda/` — API Lambda

API endpoints are exposed through the dedicated API Gateway execute-api URL, with no `/api` path prefix.
- `img-lambda/` — S3 image variant Lambda

## TODO

- optimize Projections for DynamoDB indexes
- optimize DynamoDB attributes
- map app's endpoints to api gateway
- delete public images func?
- add users email/sms notifications (prompt published/liked/disliked, user followed/blocked etc.)
- add meta info for tags and images (created_by, created_at)
- add aria attributes (+allow them in tinymce)
- add footer tag for prompt/prompts, put related prompts (Like "Futher reading", based on tags)
- replace env secrets with secrets manager storage (CS becomes slower)
- jpeg images have problems with dimensions determination (on uploads)
- add image watermarks
- add author to the footer
- update logo in google auth
- prompts page: add popular tags to "filter by tags" block
- improve prompt comments
- prompts form: submit slugs URL version (instead of queries)
- generate tag combos for prompt pages (prompt's tag combos for crawlers)
- remove personal contact details
- add user_name and user_slug attributes to prompts, render user in prompt fragments, sync when user changed
- tinymce: on image change - call api to drop the old image
- content on prompt edit page is not editable
- cover all the avaiable web/API endpoints with integrations tests
- refactor prompt voting: vote from 0 to 5 (by star selection), user rating recalculated from prompt rating
- tags aliases: for example: cache=caching, cdn=content-delivery-network, etc.
- prompt page: similar prompts section shows no the all prompts
- prompt page: auto append/generate "More Prompts to Read" paragraph
- file uploader with preview and TinyMCE image upload by URL
